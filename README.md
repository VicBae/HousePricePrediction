# HousePricePrediction
Kaggle Competition on prediction of each home

This dataset has 79 variables describing almost every aspect of residentail homes in Ames, Iowa. It is our goal to predict house sale prices based on that.

I started this project with simple EDA and data cleaning and engineering.
It utilizes the model of the following
- Ridge
- Lasso
- XGBoost

At first try I've got top 27 percentile.

Expected to achieve far better with optimization with XGBoost and stacking multiple models.

I will keep updating on this project for further studies in linear regression.
